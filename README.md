## Summary
Overall because the results are temperature focused a lot more analysis should be done on the weather to determine if the shop should be open year around. Based solely on the average temperature between June and December the weather stays rather steady in the 70â€™s, which is great for a surf and ice cream shop. More analysis should be done on the other months of the year and not just June and December and a query that looks at temperatures year around should be done. Another query should also be performed that looks into other weather factors such as precipitation, tropical storm patterns, and surf swell given the nature of the business we are assisting.
